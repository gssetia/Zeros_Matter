## <a name="intro"></a>What is Flipsies?

Do you find checkers boring? Do you find chess time-consuming? Then Flipsies is the perfect game for you! 

Flipsies is our Python spin-off of the famous strategy board game "Othello". With a colourful blue-and-black theme, intuitive 
interface, and fast installation, Flipsies can be enjoyed by all ages. 

Flipsies uses an 8-by-8 board and requires 2 players. Player 1 can only place white stones, and Player 2 can only place black 
stones. Initially, the board has two black stones and two white stones arranged in the centre of the board, and gameplay 
branches out from the centre. The objective is to have all the stones on the board coloured your colour by the end of the 
game.

The rules of Flipsies are very straightforward. During their turn, each player can place a stone in the same diagonal, column, 
or row of another stone of their colour. If any opponent's pieces lie in the middle, they are "flipped": white pieces 
become black and black pieces become white. Gameplay ends either when there are no remaining spots on the board to place 
stones, or when all the stones on the board display the same colour.

All gameplay is controlled by mouse input, and there are no keyboard commands. 

First, click the "Play" button to enter the game screen. Once a board appears, click on the squares on the board to place stones. 

Important: A stone will only be placed on the board once clicked **if the move is valid according to the rules of Flipsies. 

Continue to place stones, alternating players for each turn. The game will automatically proceed to the winning screen once 
the game detects that a player has won.
