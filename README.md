Do you find checkers boring? Do you find chess time-consuming? Then Flipsies is the perfect game for you! 

Flipsies is our Python spin-off of the famous strategy board game "Othello". With a colourful blue-and-black theme, intuitive 
interface, and fast installation, Flipsies can be enjoyed by everyone. 

The game uses an 8-by-8 grid and requires 2 players. Initially, the board has two black stones and two white stones arranged 
in the centre of the board. One player can only place white stones, and the other player can only place black stones. The 
objective is to have all the stones on the board coloured your colour by the end of the game. 

In Flipsies, a player can place a stone in the same diagonal, column, or row of another stone of their colour. If any 
opponent's pieces lie in the middle, they are "turned over": white pieces become black and black pieces become white.
