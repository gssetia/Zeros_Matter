Well, do you like chess? Do you have little time on your hands? Then Flipsies is the perfect game for you. 

Flipsies is based on the game Othello. It is a turn-based strategy board game played on an 8-by-8 board, and it requires 2 players. The game uses 64 disks that are white on one side and black on the other side, but not all disks need to be used for a player to win. 

The winning condition is fulfilled either when all the disks on the board have the same coloured side facing up, or when there are no more squares available on the board. In the case of the latter, the winner is whoever has the most disks of their colour facing up.
